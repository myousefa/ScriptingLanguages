Class: CSS 390 - Scripting Languages

Professor: Dr.Morris Bernstein

Languages Used: Bash, Sed, Awk, Perl, and Python

## Class Description

Scripting languages are used in industry to save developers time. In exchange for robustness the developer is able to save time.

In this class I learned the fundamentals of scripting in Bash, Sed, Awk, Perl, and Python. Some of the tools and utilities that we learned include pipelining, text processing, applications of regex, and more. 

See class [home page](https://courses.washington.edu/css390/scripting/2020-q4/index.html) for more details on the class and the various projects. 

## Class Objectives
1. What are scripting language and its uses
2. Shell processing (pipelines, filters, unix utils, loops, conditionals, and functions/methods)
3. Applications of RegEx (sed and awk)
4. Gain experience in Perl 
5. Gain experience with python scrpting
    - Commonly used Python libs (os, re collections, json, csv, itertools)
    - Decorator functionality 
    - Lambda expressions and closure
    - Dynamic classes and meta classes
6. Declarative programming and DSLs (Domain Specific Languages)

## Project Descriptions
**Note: More detailed descriptions in respective project folders!** 

Assignment 1 -- File Management using bash, sed, and awk

Assignment 2 -- Generating HTML website with built in file management using python and perl

Assignment 3 -- Logging and generating maps and comparing maps using python

Assignment 4 -- Creating website requests, collecting data, and using MatPlotLib to visualize the data

Assignmetn 5 -- Implemented a Finite State Machine Generator in Python that writes a basic FSM in C++

## Midterm Practice --

Practice is in bash, awk, sed, or Perl. Some practice done using python

## Final Practice -- 

Only used Python for this exam so all practice is done in python. 

## Final Takeaways

I would say I was quite successful in completing the class objectives for this course. I now have new techniques in my toolbelt that are very practical. I also have gotten first hand experience in bash scripting, perl scripting, and python scripting. Some of these skills will definitely carry into my programming career and others I feel will not (perl scripting). Very useful class definitely reccommend to all UWB students.
