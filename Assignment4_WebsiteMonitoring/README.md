## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to delve further into python scripting. In this project, the goal was to build a website that send traffic to it and monitor how it handles the requests. It also builds on the foundations using the math.lib library built into python. This will be handy in industry as it is a frequently used library. The following sections will mention implementation details so be sure to read on to understand the project in more depth and how I implemented it. 

### Part 1 : Traffic Generator
